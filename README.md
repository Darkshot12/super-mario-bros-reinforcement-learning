# super-mario-bros-reinforcement-learning
My implementation of an RL model to play the NES Super Mario Bros using Stable-Baselines3 (SB3). As of today (Aug 14 2022) the trained PPO agent completed World 1-1. 

The pre-trained models are located under ./models. To run these models run ./smb-ram-ppo-play.ipynb. 

To train a new model run ./smb-ram-ppo-train.ipynb.
